# Bell Schedule

In the app, the Bell Schedule view can be found in Events, then by tapping the 'Bells' button in the top right. During the school day, this button will say 'Period * starts/ends at *'. Note that this button will not appear on weekends or (most) no school days. 

At all times on school days cycle day is indicated by the circled number,the schedule type is indicated by the bold title, and the day's bells are displayed below. The next bell (ex: Period 1a ends at 8:57 AM) and the time remaining until that bell are displayed below the title before and during school. 


## How it Works

The Bell Schedule is configured automatically based on the type of schedule (Mass, Assembly, etc.) and the cycle day. Both of these are determined based on the events calendar. 

A few things to note:

* Because the schedule relies on the calendar, the app must be opened to refresh the schedule in the event there is a schedule change. 
* 'Special' mass or assembly schedules are not supported at this time. 


## Add the Bell Schedule Widget

Another convenient feature of the Bell Schedule is the widget that lives in the Today View. The Today View can be reached to the left of either your lock screen or home screen. 

To add the widget:

1. Unlock you device
2. Go to the today view
3. Scroll to the bottom and tap the 'Edit' button
4. Scroll down to the 'More Widgets' section and tap to add 'CHS Bell Schedule'
