# Mineola LIRR Arrivals Widget

Using the LIRR widget, you can view arriving trains at Mineola Station.

In order, the columns display: line color, destination, schedule time, estimated time of arrival/status, & track number.

## How it Works

The widget fetches train information from the MTA every 15 seconds. 

A few things to note:

* If a train is cancelled or held, the estimated arrival will display 'CANC' or 'HELD', respectively.
* An internet connection is required for the widget.
* A train may show as arriving (flashing 0m) for longer than the train is actually at the station.
* As a general rule of thumb, predict that the arrival time will be accurate to plus or minus 2 minutes. Don't rely on it if you're extremely tight on making a train.
